# Pipeline Installation

The entire pipeline is run on your **local PC**. It consists of two main parts:

1. One **Unreal Engine Blueprint** "_MapGrabAssets.uasset_" to be added to the [Squad SDK](https://squad.gamepedia.com/Squad_SDK) for exporting the game data.
2. Different **JavaScripts** for processing, converting and uploading the exported game data to the wiki.

### Installing Blueprint MapGrabAssets.uasset

The latest version of the [Squad SDK](https://squad.gamepedia.com/Squad_SDK) is required. You will find instructions on how to install the Squad SDK [here](https://squad.gamepedia.com/Squad_SDK#Downloading_the_Epic_Games_Launcher).

Please note, you will have to repeat steps 4-15 after every new release version of the Squad SDK. To find out more about Blueprints, see [official documentation](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Engine/Blueprints/GettingStarted/index.html). You can see all versions of the Squad SDK [here](https://squad.gamepedia.com/Squad_SDK#Version_history).

1. Place the blueprint within the SDK folders. It's recommended that the Blueprint is placed at `/SquadEditor/Squad/Content/Wiki/`.
